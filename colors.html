It is applicable in the mid-to-high frequency range and is in this regime computationally more efficient than traditional deterministic approaches such as finite element and boundary element methods. In comparision to conventional statistical approaches such as statistical energy analysis, dynamic energy analysis provides more structural details and is less problematic with respect to subsystem division. The dynamic energy analysis predicts the flow of vibrational wave energy across complex strucutres in terms of linear transport equations. These equations are tehn discretized and solved on meshes. Simulations of the vibro-acousitc properties of complex structures such as cars, ships, airplanes, are routinely carried out in various design stages. For low frequences, the established method of choice is the finite element method. But high frequency analysis using finite element method requires very fine meshes of the body structure to capture the shorter wavelengths and therefore is computationally extremely costly. The strucural response at high frequencies is very sensitve to small variations in material properties, geometry and boundary conditions. This makes the output of a single finite element method calculation less reliable and makes ensemble averages necessary, further enhancing computational cost. At high frequencies, other numerical methods with better computational efficiency are preferable.</p><p id="dodgerblue">Dynamic energy analysis is a method for numerically modelling structure borne sound and vibration in complex structures.
