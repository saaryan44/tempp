<body><div class="centered">Dynamic energy analysis is a method for numerically modelling structure borne sound and vibration in complex structures. It is applicable in the mid-to-high frequency range and is in this regime computationally more efficient than traditional deterministic approaches such as finite element and boundary element methods.
